# Rolling shutter correction
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01601.pdf and https://github.com/zzh-tech/RSCD are SUPER promising wrsp to automatic rolling shutter correction and deblurring

Also a nice collection of distortion-correction techniques: https://github.com/subeeshvasu/Awesome-Image-Distortion-Correction

# Rolling shutter correction _AND_ video stabilization
THis is an improvement apparently on the idea that pixels can move within a row.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9411701
"Then, different from other 2D rolling shutter removal methods that assume the pixels in the same row have a single intra-frame motion, we build a novel mesh-based intra-frame motion calculation model to cope with the depth variation in a mesh row and obtain more faithful estimation results. Finally, temporal and spatial motion constraints and an adaptive weight assignment strategy are considered together to generate the optimal warping transformations for different motion situations.
